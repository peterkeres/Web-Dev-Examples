        Here is where some type of story why you wanted to create the DC bench and what got you to this point
        <br>
        something like This
        <br>
        <br>
        The DCB was inspired by their daughter, Jenna, who is physically
        challenged and uses a wheelchair. The idea for the DCB came about
        entirely by necessity. The Fernandezes encountered obstacles while on
        outings with her. While visiting restaurants, movies, shows, etc with Jenna,
        there werenâ€™t any facilities to meet her bathroom needs. They felt Jenna
        should have the dignity to use the bathroom facilities, just as everyone
        else. And thus, the DCB was created.
