# Internet Programming Final

### Purpose:
A client wanted a prototype for a website to sell her product. Her product was the 'DC' bench. This website ws to be nothing more than a prototype. Meaning they didn't expect it to fully work or be up to production ready level. They simply wanted inspiration for the web developer the client already had working on her website.
