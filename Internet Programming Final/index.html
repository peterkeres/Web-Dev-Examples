        Here is where some type of summary/ selling pitch on the DC bench is made
        <br>
        something like This
        <br>
        <br>
        The DCB is designed to provide accessibility for people who have
        incontinence issues and are physically challenged in the public sector.
        Especially designed for people who are unable to transfer to the commode
        and require a place to sit or lie down to address their bathroom needs. It
        provides dignity by allowing people of all abilities an opportunity to venture
        out into their communities without hesitation.
