1. Create a folder Midterm Exam<yourInitials> on your local machine. Using the links on the CougarView Midterm Exam, download and save in the folder, the Midterm Exam instructions (this file) and the images.zip file. Unzip images.zip to have a subfolder, images, with .jpg and gif images you’ll use for developing the web pages.

2. Develop in your Midterm Exam<yourInitials> folder:
- nomadLtd<yourInitials>.html web page
- underConstruction<yourInitials>.html web page
- nomad.css Cascading Style Sheet

1. Develop two-column page layout nomadLtd<yourInitials>.html web page that consists of left navigation, main, and footer elements. See the screenshot below for a similar web page. Use external CSS nomad.css to configure the elements of
the web page. The left column is a navigation area with links for Gears, Travel, and About Us. All links have to point to your
underConstruction<yourInitials>.html page. Use the following images for the left column: nomad.gif, gear.gif, travel.gif, about.gif. The right column contains main with a logo (welcome.jpg), two headers – Nomad winter tours! (in red) and Schedule your vaccine against cabin fever (in black). Below the headers you have three pictures (athlete.gif, arts.gif, and leisure.gif). At the bottom of the main add another one – skibar.jpg. All images on the main element have to be links to the underConstruction<yourInitials>.html page. All elements on the main must be centered. The footer must contain the following text: Copyright © 2018 Last Updated on 10/04/2018, italics, positioned at the right side of the footer. Use a background color #eeeeee for the left column and background.gif as a background for the web page, main, and footer.

1. Develop a underConstruction<yourInitials>.html web page that looks as the web page snapshot. You can use the construction.jpg image from the images folder and the nomad.css developed for the nomadLtd<yourInitials>.html web page

1. Develop an external cascading style sheet nomad.css and apply it to the nomadLtd<yourInitials>.html and underConstruction<yourInitials>.html Web pages.
